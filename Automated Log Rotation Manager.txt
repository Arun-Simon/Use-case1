Automated Log Rotation Manager

Problem Statement: Application logs grow indefinitely

Objective: To build a shell-based log rotation tool that:
		Compresses old logs
		Deletes logs older than X days
		Maintains rotation history
		Logs all operations

Solution:

Created a new empty log file using touch command.
Initially, defined the log directory and archive directory where compressed logs go.
Using find to get the logs older than 1 day.
Compressed logs using gzip and moves them to the archive folder.
Using find to get the logs older than 7 days, and deleted them.
Maintains all the rotation logs.


Note: Since the log and the set of code was created today, that is no logs are older than 1 day, output will be empty.
